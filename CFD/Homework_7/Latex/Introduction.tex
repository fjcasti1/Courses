In this assignment we will study a two dimentional mixing chamber. Unlike the previous assignment, in this case we include the continuity equation. Thus, we will have an actual outlet flow through the outlet imposing such equation. In addition, we have included the pressure term as well. First we will show the results requested from the simulation and the code. At the end of the document we will present the equations in sub-index form for the Poisson equation and the projection step of the fractional step method, and the boundary conditions for the Lagrange multiplier. To finish, the calculation of the coefficients that characterize the fully developed velocity profiles given information of the inlets and the average velocities.
