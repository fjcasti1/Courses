In this assignment we will study a one dimensional hyperbolic PDE
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}+a(x,t)\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}=0,
\end{align*}
with a discontinuous boundary condition and a sinusoidal velocity $a(x,t)$. We will use a the total variation diminishing (TVD) third order Runge-Kutta method, abbreviated $TVD~RK3$, to solve the PDE in time and a fith order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory Scheme, abreviated $WENO-5$, to solve the spatial derivative.
