{\bf Convergence at a Point of Discontinuity:} Suppose $f$ is periodic function and piecewise continuous. Suppose $x$ is a point where $f$ is left and right differentiable (but not necessarily continuous). Then the Fourier series of $f$ at $x$ converges to $\frac{f(x-0)+f(x+0)}{2}$, i.e., converges to the average of the left and right limits of $f$.
