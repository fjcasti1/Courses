{\bf Time Invariance:} A transformation $L$ (mapping signals to signals) is said to be time-invariant if for any signal $f$ and any real number $a$, $L[f_a](t)=(Lf)(t-a)$ for all $t$. In other words, $L$ is time-invariant if the time shifted input signal $f(t-a)$ is transformed by $L$ into the time shifted output signal $(Lf)(t-a)$.
