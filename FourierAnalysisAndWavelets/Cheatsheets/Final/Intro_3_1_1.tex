{\bf Set of n-periodic sequences:} Let $\mathcal{S}_n$ be the set of $n$-periodic sequences of complex numbers. Each element $y={y_j}_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}$ in $\mathcal{S}_n$, can be thought of as a periodic discrete signal where $y_j$ is the value of the signal at a time node $t=t_j$. The sequence $y_j$ is $n$-periodic if $y_{k+n}=y_k$ for any integer $k$.
