{\bf Lemma 2.16:} Let $L$ be a linear, time-invariant transformation and let $\lambda$ be any fixed real number. Then, there is a function $h$ with $L(e^{i\lambda t})=\sqrt{2\pi}\hat{h}(\lambda)e^{i\lambda t}$. In other words, the output signal from a time-invariant filter of a sinusoidal input is also sinusoidal with the same frequency.
