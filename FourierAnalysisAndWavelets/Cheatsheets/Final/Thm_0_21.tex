{\bf Orthogonal Projection:} Suppose $V$ is an inner product space and $V_0$ is an $N$-dimensional subspace with orthonormal basis $\{e_1,e_2,\dots , e_N\}$. The orthogonal projection of a vector $v\in V$ onto $V_0$ is given by $v_0=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left\langle v,e_j\right\rangle e_j$. In addition, $\left|\left|v-v_0\right|\right|=\min_{w\in V_0}\left|\left|v-w\right|\right|$
