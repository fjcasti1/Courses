{\bf Shannon-Whittaker Sampling Theorem:} Suppose that $\hat{f}(\lambda)$ is piecewise smooth and continuous and that $\hat{f}(\lambda)=0$ for $|\lambda|>\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is some fixed, positive frequency. Then $f=\mathcal{F}^{-1}[f]$ is completely determined by its values at the poiints $t_j=\frac{j\pi}{\Omega}, j=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\dots$. More precisely, $f$ has the following series expansion: $f(t)=\sum_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(\frac{j\pi}{\Omega}\right)\frac{\sin(\Omega t-j\pi)}{\Omega t-j\pi}$, where the series converges uniformly.
