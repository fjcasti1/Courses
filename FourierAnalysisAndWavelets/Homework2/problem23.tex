\question{Sketch two periods of the pointwise limit of the Fourier series for each of the following functions. State wether or not each function's Fourier series converges uniformly. \newline

(e) $f(x)=\cos(x)+|\cos(x)|$, $-\pi\leq x\leq \pi$.
}
\begin{solution}
As we can see in the next figure, the function $f$ is continuous, piecewise smooth and $2\pi$-periodic. Hence, by \textsl{Theorem .30}, the Fourier Series for this function converges uniformly to it.
