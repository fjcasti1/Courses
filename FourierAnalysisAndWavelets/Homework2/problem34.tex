\question{Consider the function
\begin{align*}
f(x)=e^{-x^2/10}\left(\cos 2x+2\sin 4x+0.4\cos 2x\cos 40x\right)~.
\end{align*}
For what values of $n$ would you expect the Fourier coefficients $a(n)$ and $b(n)$ to be significant. Why? Compute the $a(n)$ and $b(n)$ through $n=50$ and see if you are right. Plot the partial Fourier series through $n=6$ and compare with the plot of the original $f(x0$.
