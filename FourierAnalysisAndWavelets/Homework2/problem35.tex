\question{Consider the function
\begin{align*}
g(x)=e^{-x^2/8}\left(\cos 2x+2\sin 4x+0.4\cos 2x\cos 10x\right)~.
\end{align*}
Compute the partial Fourier series through $N=25$. Throw away any coefficients that are smaller than $0.01$ in absolute value. Plot the resulting series and compare with the original function $g(x)$. Try experimenting with different tolerances.
