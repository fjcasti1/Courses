\question{\textit{Compression}. Let $tol=1.0$. In exercise 7, if $|\hat{y}_k|<tol$ then set $\hat{y}_k$ equal to zero. Apply the inverse fast Fourier transform to this new set of $\hat{y}_k$ to compute the $y_k$; plot the new values of $y_k$ and compare with the original function. Experiment with other values of $tol$. Keep track of the percentage of Fourier coefficients which have been filtered out. Compute hte relative $l^2$ error of the compressed signal as compared with the original signal.
