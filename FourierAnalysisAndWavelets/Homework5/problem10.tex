\question{Filter the wavelet coefficients computed in exercise 9 by setting to zero any wavelet coefficient whose absolute value is less than $tol=0.1$. Then reconstruct the signal as described in Section 4.4. Plot the reconstructed $f_8$ and compare with the original signal. Compute the relative $l^2$ difference between the original signal and the compressed signal. Experiment with various tolerances. Keep track of the percentage of wavelet coefficients that have been filetered out.
