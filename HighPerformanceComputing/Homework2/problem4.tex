\question{How many possible nonnegative normalized IEE single precitions floating point numbers are there?
}
\begin{solution}
Since we have 24 bits of mantisa and one of them is fixed, we have $2^{23}$ possibilities due to the mantissa. The exponent multiplies those possibilities by $127\times 2$. Hence, the number of possible nonnegative normalized IEE single precitions floating point numbers is $N=254\times 2^{23}$
\end{solution}
