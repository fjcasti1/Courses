\question{True or False: If $x$ has a terminating base$-2$ expansion, then $x$ has a terminatiing base$-10$ expansion.
}
\begin{solution}
Let $x=p/q$. Since $x$ has base$-2$ expansion, $q$ divides some power of $2$,
\begin{align*}
\frac{2^e}{q}=K\in \Z.
\end{align*}
Now we have some power $e$ of $10$ divided by $q$,
\begin{align*}
\frac{10^e}{q}=\frac{2^e5^e}{q}=K5^e=C\in \Z.
\end{align*}
Hence, if $q$ divides some power of $2$, it also divides some that same power of $10$ (since $10$ is multiple of $2$). Therefore, since $q$ divides some power of $10$, $x=p/q$ has a terminating base$-10$ expansion. 

The assertion is TRUE.
