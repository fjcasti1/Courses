% Example 4.6
{\bf Exmp 4.6}. (a) $\C^n$ is an inner product space (actually a Hilbert space, i.e. a complete inner product space) with the inner product $\langle x,y \rangle = \sum_{j=1}^nx_j\bar{y}_j$.  An orthonormal basis for $\C^n$ is given by $\{e^j\}_{j=1,\dots,n}$ where $e^j$ is the vector with all coordinates 0 except the $j^{th}$ which is 1. (b) Let $\ell^2$ be the space of all real sequences $(x_j)$ with $\sum_{j=1}^n|x_j|^2 < \infty. \; \ell^2$ is a Hilbert space with inner product $\langle x,y \rangle = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} x_j y_j, x=(x_j), y=(y_j)\in \ell^2$. An orthonormal basis is given by $\{e^k\}_{k\in \N}$ where $e^k$ is the sequence with $e_j^k=0, j \neq k, e_j^k=1, j=k$.
