{\bf Exercise 4.2.2}. Let $X$ be a Hilbert space. Let $M=\{v_m;m\in \N\}$ be an orthonormal subset of $X$. Show: $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \langle u,v_m\rangle v_m$ converges for every $u \in X$. Warning: This means that the Fourier series of $u$ converges, but it may happen that it does not equal $u$ (unless $M$ is an orthonormal basis). {\it Proof}. Combine Bessel's inequality with Exercise 4.2.1 choosing $\alpha_v = \langle u,v \rangle \qed$
