{\bf T 5.4}. Let $f$ be integrable and $\int_0^L|f(x)|dx < \infty$. Then the series $u$ in (5.2) with (5.4) and (5.3) converges unif on $[0,L] \times [\epsilon,\infty)$ for all $\epsilon >0$. Morover $u$ is infinitely often diff on $[0,L] \times (0, \infty)$ and satisfies the (PDE) and (BC) in (5.1).
