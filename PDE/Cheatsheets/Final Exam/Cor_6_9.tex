{\bf C6.9} Assume that $u: \bar{\Omega} \ra \R$ is cont and twice PD on $\Omega$ as above and satisfies $(Lu)(x) = 0, x \in \Omega$. Then $\min_{\partial \Omega}u \leq u(x) \leq  \max_{\partial \Omega} u, x \in \Omega$, and $\max_{\bar{\Omega}}|u| = \max_{\partial \Omega} |u|$. {\it Prf}. The 1st inequality is immediate from T6.7 and C6.8. Then, $\forall \; x\in \Omega, - \max_{\partial \Omega} |u| \leq u(x) \leq  \max_{\partial \Omega} |u|$ and $|u(x)| \leq  \max_{\partial \Omega} |u|$. Since this holds $\forall \; x \in \bar{\Omega}, \max_{\bar{\Omega}} |u| \leq  \max_{\partial \Omega} |u|$.  The opposite inequality is trivial.
