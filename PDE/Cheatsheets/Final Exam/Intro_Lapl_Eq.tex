{\bf The LE}
Let $\Omega \subseteq \R^n$ be open and $u: \Omega \ra \R$ be twice diff.  Then the Laplace operator is  $\Delta u(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n \partial_j^2 u(x), x \in \Omega$ (6.1). The Laplace equation is for a cont fctn $u: \bar{\Omega} \ra \R$ that is twice diff on $\Omega$, (PDE) $\Delta u = 0$ on $\Omega$, (BC) $u(x) = f(x), x \in \partial \Omega$ (6.2), where $\partial \Omega =\bar{\Omega} \setminus \Omega$ is the boundary of $\Omega$ and $f: \partial \Omega \ra \R$ is given.  A twice contly diff fctn $u$ on $\Omega$ that satisfies $\Delta u =0$ on $\Omega$ is called harmonic on $\Omega$.
