{\bf P7.4}. Let $\Omega \subseteq \R^n$ be open and $u: \Omega \ra \R$ be diff and $\nabla u \equiv 0$ on $\Omega$. Then $u$ is locally const on $\Omega$: for each $x \in \Omega \; \exists$  some open nbhood $U$ of $x$ s.t. $u$ is cons on $U$. If $\Omega$ is path-connected, then $u$ is const on $\Omega$.
\textbf{Recall} that $\Omega$ is path-connected if, for any $x, y \in \Omega$, there is an interval $[a,b]$ and a cont "path" $\gamma: [a,b] \ra \Omega$ s.t. $\gamma(a) = x$ and $\gamma(b)=y$. 
{\it Prf}. Let $x \in \Omega$. Since $\Omega$ is open, $\exists \; r > 0$ s.t. $U_r(x) = \{z \in \R^n; |z-x|<r \} \subseteq \Omega$.
%$ \; U_r(x)$ is the open ball with center $x$ and radius $r$. 
Let $z \in U_r(x)$. Then, $\forall \; \xi \in [0,1], |\xi z + (1-\xi)x - x|=|\xi(z-x)| \leq |z-x| < r$ and $\xi z + (1 - \xi)x \in U_r(x) \subseteq \Omega$. Thus $\phi(\xi) = u(\xi z + ( 1- \xi)x)$ is defined $\forall \; \xi \in [0,1]$ and diff, $\phi'(\xi) = \nabla u (\xi z + (1-\xi)x) \cdot (z - x) = 0$. So $u(z) = \phi(1) = \phi(0) = u(x), z \in U_r(x)$. Now assume that $\Omega$ is path-connected. Let $x,y \in \Omega$. Assume that $u(x) \neq u(y)$. There is an interval $[a,b]$ and a cont path $\gamma : [a,b] \ra \Omega$ such that $\gamma(a) = x$ and $\gamma(b)=y$ and so $\gamma(a) \neq \gamma(b)$. Let $t = \sup\{s \in [a,b]; u(\gamma(s))=u(\gamma(a))\}$. Then $a \leq t < b$ and $u(\gamma(t))=u(\gamma(a))$ because $u$ is cont. Since $u$ is locally const, $\exists$ an open ball $U$ with center $u(\gamma(t))$ such that $u(z) = u(\gamma(t))\; \forall \; z \in U$. Since $t < b$ and $\gamma$ is continous, $\exists \; s >t$ s.t. $\gamma(s) \in U$ and so $u(\gamma(s)) = u(\gamma(t)) = u(\gamma(a))$, a contradiction to the definition of $t$.  So $u(x) = u(y)$ for any two points $x$ and $y$ in $\Omega$, i.e. $u$ is const on $\Omega \qed$
