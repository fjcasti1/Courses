{\bf T7.1}. $\Omega$ is normal iff $\int_{\Omega} \partial_j g(x) dx = \int_{\partial \Omega} g(x) \nu_j (x) d \sigma(x), j = 1, \dots, n$. for every cont $g: \bar{\Omega} \ra \R$ with cont and bdd derivative on $\Omega$. {\it Prf}. $\Rightarrow$ Let $j \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ and set $f = (0, \dots, 0, g, 0, \dots, 0)$ such that $f_j = g. \Leftarrow$ Apply this formula to $g = f_j, j = 1, \dots, n$ and add over $j \qed$ The following result generalizes IBP.
