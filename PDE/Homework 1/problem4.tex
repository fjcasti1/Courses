\question{Which of the PDEs in the exercises you have been assigned are linear, semilinear, quasilinear, nonlinear?}

\begin{solution}
The PDE of Problem 3.1.3 is semilinear since the solution $u$ is not in the coefficients $a_j$, but appears in $c$ in a nonlinear way, $c=u^2$.
The PDEs of Problem 3.1.4 and Problem 3.1.6 is quasilinear because the solution $u$ appears in the coefficients $a_j$ which multiply the partial derivatives of $u$.
\end{solution}
