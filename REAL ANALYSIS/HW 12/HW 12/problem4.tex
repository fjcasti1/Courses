\question{ Let $f: [a, b] \rightarrow X$, $f$ continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on
$(a, b)$. 

Show: if $f'$ is bounded on $(a, b)$, then $f$ is Lipschitz continuous and $\sup_{t \in (a,b)} \|f'(t)\|$ is a Lipschitz constant for $f$.}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{proof}
Let $f'$ be bounded on $(a, b)$. Then, there exists $\sup_{t \in (a,b)}f'(t)$ and also $\sup_{t \in (a,b)}\|f'(t)\|$. Since $f$ is a continuous function that is differentiable on $(a,b)$, then by theorem 6.13, there exists some $t \in (a,b)$ such that
\begin{align*}
\|f(b) - f(a)\| \leq \|f'(t)\|(b-a)~.
\end{align*}
Then, by definition of a supremum,
\begin{align*}
\|f(b) - f(a)\| \leq \sup_{t \in (a,b)}\|f'(t)\|(b-a)~.
\end{align*}
Therefore, $f$ is Lipschitz continuous on $[a,b]$ with Lipschitz constant $\sup_{t \in (a,b)}\|f'(t)\|$.
