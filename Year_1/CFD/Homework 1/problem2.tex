\begin{solution}
In this problem we are asked approximate the first derivative of the function
\begin{align*}
f(x)=\frac{1+2x^2\cos{x}}{x^{2.4}},
\end{align*}
at a given point $x_0=33.3$. We can calculate the derivative analytically,
\begin{align*}
f'(x)=\frac{2x^2(2\cos{x}-x\sin{x})-2.4(1+2x^2\cos{x})}{x^{3.4}},
\end{align*}
and its value at $x_0$ is $f'(x_0)=-0.466342049195729$ using double precision in \textsc{MATLAB}. We are asked to plot, in logarithmic scale, the truncation error of three different approximations versus the step $h$. The approximations to use are
\begin{itemize}
\item First order forward diffrences:
\begin{align*}
f'_i=\frac{f_{i+1}-f_i}{h}+\mathcal{O}(h).
\end{align*}
\item Second order central diffrences:
\begin{align*}
f'_i=\frac{f_{i+1}-f_{i-1}}{2h}+\mathcal{O}(h^2).
\end{align*}
\item Sixth order central differences:
\begin{align*}
f'_i=\frac{-f_{i-3}+9f_{i-2}-45f_{i-1}+45f_{i+1}-9f_{i+2}+f_{i+3}}{60h}+\mathcal{O}(h^6).
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
Once the value of each approximation is obtained, we can compute the error for every value of the step $h$ and show it in the next figure.

The fact that the error describes a straight line of slope $m$ in logarithmic scale proves that that approximation is of order $m$ (since $\log{(kh^m)}=\log{k}+m\log h$, a straight line of slope $m$). In our case, it is clear in the figure that the approximations are, from top to bottom, indeed of order one, two and six, respectively. However, this linear dependence is broken in two areas of the figure. 

First, when $h$ is sufficiently small, the \textit{rounding-error} is dominant and we see it as a cloud of points that seem parallel to the line of slope negative one. This is due to the fact that the rounding error is of the order of $\frac{\epsilon}{h}$, where $\epsilon$ is the well known machine epsilon. An error of that order is shown in logarithmic scale as a straight line of slope negative one (since $\log{(\frac{\epsilon}{h})}=\log{\epsilon}-\log{h}$ and $\epsilon$ is constant). The point where the rounding error becomes dominant depends, of course, of the order of approximation. The higher the order, as we make $h$ small, the powers of $h$ are even smaller and when they get of the order of $\epsilon$ the computer cannot differ well enough between numbers. 

On the other hand, when $h$ is large, the terms of the error that are not the leading error term become more and more important as $h$ increases, reaching the point of not being neglectable. We can reach the point where the leading error term is not so anymore since we need $h$ to be small in order to assume that the remaining terms of the series are considerably smaller. We can see that effect in the top right corner of the figure.
