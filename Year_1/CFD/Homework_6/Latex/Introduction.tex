In this assignment we will study a two dimentional mixing chamber. First we will show the equations to solve for $u$, $v$ and $Y$. We will use a staggered mesh for $u$ and $v$ and a cell centered mesh for $Y$. I apologize to the grader since I have not been able to complete the typing of this submission. I will give pdf versions of pictures of my handwritten notes which have the equations used in my code, drawing, and more details. The notation in my notes is according to \textsl{Matlab}, i.e., the staggered meshes don't have the $1/2$. However, the first  two sections of this submission have the development for $u$ and $v$ written in such staggered notation. My notes will also have details about how I treated the boundary conditions, they will be located at the end of the document. I sincerely apologize again to the grader as I know this might cause some disturbance.
