{\bf D 4.21}. A funct $u: [0,L] \times \R \ra \R$ is a classical sol of (4.5) if $u$ is twice cont diff on $[0,L]\times \R$ and satisfies (4.5). Let $\phi: [0,L] \times \R$ be twice cont diff, $\phi(0)=0=\phi(L)$. Let $u$ be a classical sol of (3.38). Since $u$ is twice cont diff, the following derivative exists and satisfies $(d^2/dt^2)\int_0^L \phi(x) u(x,t) dx = \int_0^L \phi(x) \partial_t^2u(x,t)dx=\int_0^L\phi(x)c^2\partial_x^2u(x,t)dx$. Int by parts. Since both $\phi$ and $u$ are 0 for $x = 0,L, (d^2/dt^2)\int_0^L \phi(x)u(x,t)dx=-c^2 \int_0^L \phi'(x) \partial_x u(x,t)dx =c^2\int_0^L\phi''(x)u(x,t)dx$. Similarly  $(d/dt_{[t=0]}) \int_0^L \phi(x) u(x,t)dx = \int_0^L\phi(x)g(x)dx$.
