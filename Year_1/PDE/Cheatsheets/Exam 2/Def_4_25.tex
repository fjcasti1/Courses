{\bf D 4.25}. A twice continuously differentiable function $\phi: [0,L] \ra \R$ with $\phi'(0)=0=\phi'(L)$ is called a test function for (4.17). A function $u:[0,L] \times \R \ra \R$ is called a generalized solution of (4.17) if $u(t,\cdot) \in L^2[0,L]$ for all $t \geq 0, u(x,0)=f(x)$ for a.a. $x \in [0,L]$ and, for every test function $\phi, \int_0^L \phi(x)u(x,t)dx$ is a twice continuously differentiable function of $t \geq 0$ and $(d^2/dt^2) \int_0^L \phi(x) u(x,t)dx = c^2 \int_0^L \phi''(x) u(x,t)dx$ and $ (d/dt_{[t=0]})\int_0^L\phi(x)u(x,t)dx=\int_0^L\phi(x)g(x)dx$.
