{\bf Max principle for the heat equation} Let $\Omega$ be an open bounded subset of $\R^n. \bar{\Omega}$ denotes the closure of $\Omega$ and $\partial \Omega$ the boundary of $\Omega$. In the previous section, we have considered $\Omega = (0,L) \subseteq \R$. Then $\bar{\Omega} = [0,L]$ and $\partial \Omega = \{0,L\}$. Let $I$ be an interval.  For a function $u: \Omega \times I \ra \R$ that is once partially diff wrt $t \in I$ and twice partially diff wrt $x_k$ at each $x \in \Omega, k = 1, \dots , n$, let $(Lu)(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^n [a_k \partial_{x_k}^2 u(x,t) + b_k\partial_{x_k}u(x,t)], x \in \Omega, t \in I$ (5.19), with $a_k \geq 0$ and $b_k \in \R$ for $k = 1, \dots, n$.
