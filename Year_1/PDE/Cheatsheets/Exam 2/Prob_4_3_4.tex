{\bf Exercise 4.3.4}. Let $f: [0,L] \ra \R$ be Lipschitz continuous. Show that $f(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}A_j\cos(jx\pi/L)$ with the convergence being uniform in $[0,L], \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}|A_j|<\infty$, and $A_j=(2/L)\int_0^L f(y)\cos(jy\pi/L)dy, j \in \N$, and $A_0=(1/L)\int_0^L f(y)dy$. {\it Proof}. We extend $f$ to $[-L,L]$ by defining $f(-x)=f(x)$ for $x \in (0,L]$. We first need to check whether this extension is also Lipschitz continuous. The critical case is $-L \leq x <0 \leq y \leq L$. By the triangle inequality, $|f(y)-f(x)| \leq |f(y)-f(0)|+|f(0)-f(-x)|\leq \Lambda(y+(-x)) \leq \Lambda (y-x)$. By construction, $f(-L)=f(L)$. By Theorem 4.18, $f(x)=A_0+\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}(A_j\cos(\lambda_jx) + B_j \sin(\lambda_jx)), \lambda_j=(j\pi/L)$, with the convergence being uniform in $x \in [-L,L]$ and $A_j=(1/L)\int_{-L}^L f(y)\cos(\lambda_jy)dy, B_j=(1/L)\int_{-L}^L f(y)\sin(\lambda_jy)dy$. By the previous exercise, $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}|A_j|<\infty$. Since cosine is even and sine is odd, for $j \in \N, A_j=(1/L)\int_0^L( f(y)+f(-y))\cos(\lambda_jy)dy=(2/L)\int_0^L f(y)\cos(\lambda_jy)dy$ and  $B_j=(1/L)\int_0^L (f(y)-f(-y))\sin(\lambda_jy)dy= 0, A_0=1/(2L)\int_{-L}^L f(y)dy=1/(2L)\int_0^L (f(y)+f(-y))dy=(1/L)\int_0^L f(y)dy \qed$
