{\bf Exercise 5.1.4} Let $L, a > 0$. We change the heat diffustion problem into a problem for a diffusing population with density-dependent effect, (PDE) $(\partial_t - a \partial_x^2)u = r(t)u, 0 \leq x \leq L, t>0$, (IC) $u(x,0) = f(x), 0 \leq x \leq L$, (BC) $u(0,t) = 0 = u(L, t), t > 0$ (NL) $ r(t)=b-2c/L \int_0^L u(t,y) \sin(\lambda_1 y) dy$  with $b,c >0$. NL stands for nonlinear term. Assume that $f$ is nonnegative, continuous, and strictly positive somewhere on $(0,L)$. Derive the ODEs for the Fourier sine coefficients and consider their solutions. Notice that the first Fourier sine coefficient of a solution satisfies the logistic (aka Verhulst) differential equation and has a positive value at $t = 0$. Show that the Fourier sine series is a solution. (The convergence of the appropriate series will be uniform on every interval $[\epsilon, 1/\epsilon]$ with $0 < \epsilon < 1)$. Define the carrying capacity $K = (b-a(\pi/L)^2)/c$. Show: If $K \leq 0$, then $\int_0^L|u(x,t)|^2 dx \ra 0$ as $t \ra \infty$. $K > 0$, then $\int_0^L|u(x,t)|^2 dx \ra K^2$ as $t \ra \infty$.  Now assume in addition that $f$ is Lipschitz continuous and $f(0)=0=f(L)$. Show: If $K \leq 0$, then $u(x,t) \ra 0$ as $t \ra \infty$ unformly for $x \in [0,L]$. If $K>0$, then $u(x,t) \ra K \sin(\pi x/L)$ as $t \ra \infty$ unformly for  $x \in [0,L]$.
