{\bf T 4.11}. Let $B$ be a denumerable orthonormal basis of the IP space $X, I \subseteq \R$, and $u: I \ra X$ such that, for all $v \in B, \langle u(t),v\rangle$ is a (uniformly) cont func of $t \in I$. Let $\{\alpha_v; v \in B\}$ be a family in $\R_+$ such that $|\langle u(t),v\rangle | \leq \alpha_v$ for all $t \in I$ and $v \in B$. Assume that there is some bijective $f:  \N\ra B$ s.t. the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \alpha_{f(n)}^2$ converges in $\R$. Then $u$ is (unif) cont.  
%{\it Proof}. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Since $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\alpha_{f(n)}^2$ converges in $\R$, there exists some $m \in \N$ such that $\sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty}\alpha_{f(n)}^2 <(\epsilon/4)^2$. Set $u_m(t) = \sum_{n=1}^m \langle u(t), f(n) \rangle f(n)$. For all $t \in I$, by Fourier expansion,  $u(t) - u_m(t) = \sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty} \langle u(t), f(n) \rangle f(n)$, and by Parseval's relation,  $||u(t) - u_m(t)||^2 = \sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty} |\langle u(t), f(n) \rangle|^2\leq \sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty} \alpha_{f(n)}^2 <(\epsilon/4)^2$. So $u_m(t) \ra u(t)$ as $m \ra \infty$ uniformly for $t \in I$. Since, for each $v \in F, \langle u(t), v \rangle$ is a (uniformly) continuous function of $t \in I, u_m$ is (uniformly) continuous as finite sum of (uniformly) continuous functions.  Let $r \in I$. Then there exists some $\delta >0$ such that $||u_m(t)-u_m(r)|| < \epsilon/2$ for all $t \in I$ with $|t-r|<\delta$. So let $t \in I$ and $|t-r|<\delta$. By the triangle inequality, $||u(t)-u(r)|| \leq ||u(t)-u_m(t)||+||u_m(t)-u_m(r)|| +||u_m(r)-u(r)||\leq \epsilon/4+\epsilon/2+\epsilon/4=\epsilon$.  The proof of uniform continuity is similar. $\qed$
