{\bf E 5.3.5}. Find a fctn like the GF for the equation $(\partial_t - a \partial_x^2)u = 0, 0 \leq x \leq L, t >0, \partial_x u(0,t)=0=\partial_x u(L,t), t>0, u(x,0) = f(x), 0 \leq x \leq L$. {\it Prf}. By E 5.1.1, the solution is given by $u(x,t) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}A_m \cos(\lambda_mx)e^{-a \lambda_m^2t}$, with $\lambda_m=m\pi/L, A_m=(2/L)\int_0^Lf(y)\cos(\lambda_my)dy, m \in \N, A_0=(1/L)\int_0^L f(y)dy$. Then $u(x,t)=\int_0^L N(x,y,t)f(y)dy$ with $N(x,y,t)=(1/L)+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(2/L)\cos(\lambda_mx)\cos(\lambda_my)e^{-a\lambda_m^2t}\qed$
% The inhomogeneous heat equation
{\bf Inhomog HE} with 0 BCs (Dirichlet BCs) has the form (PDE) $(\partial_t- a \partial_x^2)u = F(x,t), 0 \leq x \leq L, t \in (0,T)$, (IC) $u(x,0) = f(x), 0 <x<L$, (BC) $u(0,t)=0=u(L,t), 0 < t \leq T$ (5.35). Again $L, a > 0$. Here $F: [0,L] \times (0,T) \ra \R$ is cont and bdd and $f: (0,L)\ra \R$ is cont and bdd. Assume $u$ and $\partial_t u$ are cont on $[0,L] \times (0,T)$. Let $G$ be the GF from the previous Section and $0<s<t<T$. Because of (5.30), we can interchange int and diff in the following, $\partial_s \int_0^L G(x,y,s)u(y,t-s)dy = \int_0^L \partial_s [G(x,y,s)u(y,t-s)]dy= \int_0^L [\partial_s G(x,y,s) u(y,t-s)+  G(x,y,s) \partial_s u(y,t-s)]dy =^{(5.31)}  \int_0^L a\partial_y^2 G(x,y,s) u(y,t-s)dy - \int_0^L  G(x,y,s) [a\partial_y^2 u(y,t-s)+F(y,t-s)]dy= -\int_0^L  G(x,y,s) F(y,t-s)dy$, where the last equation follows from IBP.  We int this equation over $s$ from $\epsilon$ to $t, 0<\epsilon < t, \int_0^L G(x,y,t)u(y,0)dy - \int_0^L G(x,y,\epsilon) u(y, t-\epsilon) dy = -\int_{\epsilon}^t(\int_0^L G(x,y,s) F(y,t-s)dy)ds$. Take the lim of the rhs as $\epsilon \ra 0$. As for the 2nd expn on the lhs, $|\int_0^L G(x,y,\epsilon)u(y,t-\epsilon)dy - u (x,t)| \leq |\int_0^L G(x,y,\epsilon)(u(y,t-\epsilon) - u (y,t))dy| + |\int_0^L G(x,y,\epsilon)u(y,t)dy - u (x,t)|$. The last expn tends to 0 by P 5.18 (a). By part (b) of this very prop, the last but one expn can be est by $\sup_{0 \leq y \leq L} |u(y,t-\epsilon) - u(y,t)|$ which tends to 0 as $\epsilon \ra 0$, because $u$ is unif cont on $[0,L] \times [t/2, t]$.
