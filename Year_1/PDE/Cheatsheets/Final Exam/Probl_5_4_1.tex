{\bf E5.4.1}. Let $F: [0,L] \times [0,T] \ra \R$ be cont and Lipschitz cont in the space variable, $F(0,t) = 0 = F(L, t)\; \forall \; t \in [0,T]$. Derive (5.37) for a solution $\tilde{u}$ of $(\partial_t - a \partial_x^2)\tilde{u} = F$, on $[0,L] \times [0,T], u(x,0)=0, 0 \leq x \leq L, \tilde{u}(0,t) = 0 = \tilde{u}(L,t), 0 \leq t \leq T$, directly expressing $\tilde{u}$ and $F$ by their Fourier sine series and deriving and solving ODEs for the Fourier coefficients of $\tilde{u}$.
