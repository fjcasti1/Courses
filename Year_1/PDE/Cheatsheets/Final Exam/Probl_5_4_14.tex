{\bf E5.4.14}. Let $u: [0,L] \times [0,T] \ra \R$ be cont and twice contly diff. Let $F: [0,L] \times [0,T] \ra \R$ be cont.  Assume $\partial_t u(x,t) - a \partial_x^2 u(x,t) = F(x,t), 0 \leq t \leq T, 0 \leq x \leq L, \partial_x u(0,t) = 0 = \partial_x u(L,t), t \in [0, T], u(x,0)=0, 0 \leq x \leq L$. Derive a Fourier series rep of $u$.  You may interchange int, diff and series without prf.  You do not need to discuss convergence of the series. {\it Prf}. Because of the BCs, we choose a Fourier cosine rep, $u(x,t)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}A_m(t) \cos(\lambda_m x), \lambda_m$ = $(m \pi)/L, m \in \Z, A_m(t) = 2/L \int_0^L u(x,t) \cos(\lambda_m x) dx, m \in \N, A_0(t)= 1/L \int_0^L u(x,t) dx$ (5.47). Let $m \in \N$. Interchange diff and int, $A_m'(t) = 2/L \int_0^L \partial_t u(x,t) \cos(\lambda_m x) dx$. Use the PDE for $u, A_m'(t) = 2/L \int_0^L (a \partial_x^2 u(x,t) + F(x,t))\cos(\lambda_m x) dx$.  IBP twice and use that the boundary terms are 0 because of the BCs for $u$ and $\sin(\lambda_m x) = 0$ for $x = 0$ and $x = L,\; A_m'(t) = 2/L \int_0^L u(x,t) a \partial_x^2 \cos(\lambda_m x) dx + \hat{F}_m (t)$ with $\hat{F}_m (t)= 2/L \int_0^L F(x,t)\cos(\lambda_m x) dx$. By the diff properties of cosine, $A_m'(t) = -a \lambda_m^2 A_m(t) + \hat{F}(t)$. Further $A_m(0)=0$ by the initial conditions for $u$. We use the variation of consts formula, $A_m(t) = \int_0^t e^{-a \lambda_m^2 (t-s)}\hat{F}_m(s) ds$. Further, since $u$ satisfies the PDE and the no-flux BCs, $A_0'(t) = 1/L \int_0^L \partial_t u(x,t)dx$ = $1/L \int_0^L (a \partial_x^2 u(x,t)+ F(x,t))dx = (1/L)a [ \partial_x u(L,t)-\partial_x u(0,t)]+1/L\int_0^L F(x,t)dx = 1/L \int_0^L F(x,t)dx$, and $A_0 = 0$ because of the zero initial values for $u$. This implies $A_0(t)=\int_0^t 1/L \int_0^L F(x,s)dxds$.  Together with $A_m(t) = \int_0^t e^{-a \lambda_m^2 (t-s)}2/L ( \int_0^L F(x,s) \cos (\lambda_m x)dx)ds$, $m \in \N$, and $u(x,t)$ = $\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} A_m (t) \cos(\lambda_m x), t \geq 0, 0 \leq x \leq L$, This provides the Fourier series representation of $u \qed$
