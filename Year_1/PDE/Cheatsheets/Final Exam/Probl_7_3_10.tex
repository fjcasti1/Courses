{\bf E7.3.10}. Let $X$ be a Hilbert space with inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$. Let $I$ be an interval with end points $a$ and $b, a < b$, and $f, g: I \ra X$ two functions that are diff at some point $t \in I$. Define $\phi: I \ra \C$ by $\phi(t) = \langle f(t), g(t) \rangle$. Show that $\phi$ is diff at $t$ and derive a formula for $\phi'(t)$. {\it Prf}. Let $t, s \in I$.  By the properties of the inner product, $\phi(s) - \phi(t) = \langle f(s) - f(t), g(s) \rangle + \langle f(t), g(s) - g(t) \rangle$, and $(\phi(s) - \phi(t))/(s-t) = \langle (f(s) - f(t))/(s-t), g(s) \rangle + \langle f(t), (g(s) - g(t))/(s-t) \rangle$. Since the inner product is a continuous function from $X \times X \ra \C$ as a consequence of the Cauchy Schwarz inequality and $(f(s) - f(t))/(s-t) \ra f'(t), (g(s) - g(t))/(s-t) \ra g'(t), g(s) \ra g(t), s \ra t$, we have $\phi(s) - \phi(t))/(s-t) \ra  \langle f'(t), g(t) \rangle + \langle f(t), g'(t) \rangle \qed$
