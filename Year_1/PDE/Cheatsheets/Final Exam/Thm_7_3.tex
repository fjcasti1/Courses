{\bf T7.3} (GFs). Let $\Omega, u$, and $v$ be as in the previous thm. Assume that the derivative of $v$ can and has been contly extended to $\bar{\Omega}$. If $v$ has a cont bdd second derivative on $\Omega, \int_{\Omega} u \Delta v dx + \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx = \int_{\partial \Omega} u \partial_{\nu} v d \sigma$. If both $u$ and $v$ have bdd cont second derivatives on $\Omega$ and if the first derivatives of $u$ and $v$ can and have been contly extended to $\bar{\Omega}, \int_{\Omega} (u \Delta v - v \Delta u)dx = \int_{\partial \Omega} (u \partial_{\nu} v - v \partial_{\nu} u) d \sigma$. Here $\nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \sum_{j=1}^n \partial_j u \partial_j v$ and $\partial_{\nu}v = \nu \cdot \nabla v = \sum_{j=1}^n \nu_j \partial_j v$. We mention that $\partial_{\nu} v$ is called the normal derivative of $v$. {\it Prf}. In Green's thm, replace $v$ by $\partial_j v, \int_{\Omega} (u \partial_j^2 v + \partial_j v \partial_j u)dx = \int_{\partial \Omega} u \partial_j v \nu_j d \sigma$, and add over $j$. For the 2nd formula, use the symmetry in $u$ and $v$ and subtract$\qed$
