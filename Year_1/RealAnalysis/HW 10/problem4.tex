\question{ Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces and $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be continuous. Let $S \subseteq X$. Show:

\vspace{5mm}
(a) $f(\bar{S}) \subseteq \overline{f(S)}$.}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{proof}
Let $y \in f(\bar{S})$, then there exists an $x \in \bar{S}$ such that $y = f(x)$. Since $x$ is a limit point of $S$, there exists a sequence $(x_n) \in S$ such that $x_n \rightarrow x$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. 

Let $(y_n)$ be a sequence in $f(S)$ such that $y_n = f(x_n)$. Then, since $f$ is continuous and $x_n \rightarrow x$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, $y_n \rightarrow y$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Therefore, $y$ is a limit point of $f(S)$, and thus $y \in \overline{f(S)}$. 

Which implies $f(\bar{S}) \subseteq \overline{f(S)}$.

  
  \end{proof}
\end{solution}

\question{(b) If $S$ is compact, $f(\bar{S}) = \overline{f(S)}$. }

\begin{solution}
  \begin{proof}
Since $\bar{S}$ is a compact subset of $X$ and $f$ is continuous, $f(\bar{S}$ is compact by Theorem 4.50. This implies $f(\bar{S}$ is closed by theorem 4.6. Then since $f(s) \subseteq f(\bar{s})$ , by proposition 4.3, $\overline{f(s)} \subseteq f(\bar{s})$. Finally, since $f(\bar{S}) \subseteq \overline{f(S)}$ from the proof in part (a), $f(\bar{S}) = \overline{f(S)}$.
  
  \end{proof}
